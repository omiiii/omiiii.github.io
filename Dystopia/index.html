				We are aiming to create a dystopia based originally based on the video game, <a href = "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MqWZkCqI6NM">“We Happy Few”</a> a society that’s based on people doing exactly what they need to be doing; nothing is out of order, everyone is happy, and nobody ever breaks the rules. But underneath that candy coated exterior lies a dark world. One in which there is no freedom to think or do as you please, and a place where everyone’s life is forcefully directed to appear a certain way. Appearance is key.
			</p>

			<p>
				We started to think about what that means in terms of a theme park; a place where everything you know changes in the blink of a glitch. We create a dual state sign that has the ability to switch from a “regular" state, which proclaims incumbent danger upon entry to a new building or area in the park, to a “glitch” version of the sign which states that the visitor should indeed enter the space that just appeared to be prohibited and dangerous. 
			</p>

			<p>
				We want the visitor to realize that not everything is as it appears to be. If the park signs state you shouldn’t enter a building, we encourage the visitor to do the exact opposite: test the boundaries and limitations of the park as it seems. By visiting new locations, the park patrons will unlock new regions of the mapplication that they can view on their smart phone devices. The mapplication has “unknown” or blacked out spaces that can only be revealed through physically exploring those locations. 
			</p>

			<p>
				Visitors of the park are expected to do the unexpected. This isn’t like the real world. Exploring places that appear off limits is highly encouraged through our signage and mapplication app. Areas that are truly off limits to the patrons, like utility rooms or offices, will be properly hidden and unmarked. Nothing is as it seems, and we hope to create the air of unexpected, mysterious adventure where you must actively hunt for any sign that could have a dual meaning to unlock further access to areas of the park that are currently unknown.
